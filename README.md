Data Mining_Final Project

Our goal is to predict lemons (bad car buys), and to provide a detailed analysis on the data and build a model that helps tell the story about vehicles at auction. This will help dealers make better informed decisions and decrease the probability of buying a lemon.

# Outline

1. Business Problem and Data Introduction
2. Data Transformation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Recipe Creation
4. Modeling Method
5. Train Control and Tune Grids for all Models
6. Model Training and Performance Assessment
    (a) CART Model

    (c) Naive Bayes Model
    (d) GCV MARS Model
7. Model Comparisions with TidyPosterior
8. Predicting on the Test Set
